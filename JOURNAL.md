## 10/15/2025 - Research, Parts search, Starting CAD  

I did a bit of research on how best to create some headphones. After about two hours, i decided that I wanted to design some passive headphones, since I am not confident at all on being able to design a functioning Bluetooth audio receiver and amplifier board. So instead, I decided to opt for the simpler, and cheaper route of passive headphones. Also, it'll mean I get to try out creating my own dual TS to TRRS cable for the first time! In addition, it means that I would be able to buy the parts for more myself, to, for example, give as gifts!

## 10/16/2025 - Printed first prototype, modified headbar and audio jack  

I started by printing V0.1 of the headphones, which took about 5 hours of printing. After printing, I loosely assembled everything, and discovered several things: the headbar was too small, and the audio jack connector wouldn't be able to be fastened to the case properly (whoops!). I then took about an hour or so to fix these issues and started printing V0.2!
Also, i discovered that the padding from my Skullcandy Hesh Evo headphones fits onto my design, which means that I'll have something I can base my padding off of!
