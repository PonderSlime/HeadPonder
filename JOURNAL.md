## 10/15/2025 - Research, Parts search, Starting CAD  

I did a bit of research on how best to create some headphones. After about two hours, i decided that I wanted to design some passive headphones, since I am not confident at all on being able to design a functioning Bluetooth audio receiver and amplifier board. So instead, I decided to opt for the simpler, and cheaper route of passive headphones. Also, it'll mean I get to try out creating my own dual TS to TRRS cable for the first time! In addition, it means that I would be able to buy the parts for more myself, to, for example, give as gifts!
